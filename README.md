# axum-liveview

axum-liveview allows you to build rich, real-time experiences with
server-rendered HTML. This is done entirely in Rust - no JavaScript or WASM
needed.

Basically [Phoenix LiveView][phx] but for [axum].

# ðŸš¨ BIG SCARY WARNING ðŸš¨

This project is still very much work in progress. Everything is subject to
change and you shouldn't use this for anything serious.

# Example usage

This is what using axum-liveview looks like.

```rust
use axum::{async_trait, response::IntoResponse, routing::get, Router};
use axum_live_view::{html, AssociatedData, EmbedLiveView, Html, LiveView};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // liveviews must send and receive messages both from the browser and from
    // other parts of your application. `axum_live_view::pubsub` is how that is
    // done.
    //
    // It allows you publish messages to topics and subscribe to a stream
    // of messages in a particular topic.
    //
    // `InProcess` is a pubsub implementation that uses `tokio::sync::broadcast`.
    let pubsub = axum_live_view::pubsub::InProcess::new();

    // A normal axum router.
    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/", get(root))
        // liveview has a few routes of its own that you have to include.
        .merge(axum_live_view::routes())
        // liveview also has a middleware that you must include.
        .layer(axum_live_view::layer(pubsub));

    // We run the app just like any other axum app
    axum::Server::bind(&"0.0.0.0:3000".parse().unwrap())
        .serve(app.into_make_service())
        .await
        .unwrap();
}

// Our handler function for `GET /`
async fn root(
    // `EmbedLiveView` is an extractor that is hooked up to the liveview setup
    // and enables you to embed liveviews into HTML templates.
    embed_liveview: EmbedLiveView,
) -> impl IntoResponse {
    // `Counter` is our liveview and we initialize it with the default values.
    let counter = Counter::default();

    html! {
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                // axum-liveview comes with some assets that you must load.
                { axum_live_view::assets() }
            </head>
            <body>
                // Embed our liveview into the HTML template. This will render the
                // view and include the HTML in the response, leading to good SEO
                // and fast first paint.
                //
                // It will also start a stateful async task for updating the view
                // and sending the changes down to the client via a WebSocket
                // connection.
                { embed_liveview.embed(counter) }

                // This is all the JavaScript you need to write to initialize
                // the liveview connection and handle updates.
                <script>
                    r#"
                        const liveView = new LiveView({ host: 'localhost', port: 3000 })
                        liveView.connect()
                    "#
